A simple game of TicTacToe against a computer player.

Select your token and the CPU player difficulty and begin the game. Play by clicking on the square you would like to place your X/O.

On easy difficulty the CPU will make a random move, on hard difficulty it will use the minimax algorithm to select a move. 

On win/lose you will have the option to select a new token and CPU difficulty and play again.

This was made for The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum as a project to learn about factory functions and interacting with the DOM, and ended up being a very fun personal project that I'm proud of! I have implemented minimax once before for Harvard CS50's AI course, however you were given the actual code for the Tic Tac Toe game in the distribution code for the project and were simply tasked with writing the functions for minimax in Python. This project allowed me to also design the game and the window and to implement the code that actually used the algorithm and was a great learning experience!
